The CSRM metamodel is a .mdzip project that describes the CSRM specification using UML classes. 

The metamodel is composed of a data model and a process model. 

The data model contains CSRM-specific model elements that describe "things", such as a <<Mission>>.

The process model contains CSRM-specific relationships such as <<Validation>>.

The intent of the metamodel is to provide a greater understanding of the CSRM model elements and the allowable relationships between them.

It is complemented by the CSRM ontology.

The CSRM ontology was created in Protege using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). 

The .ofn file is currently in progress.
