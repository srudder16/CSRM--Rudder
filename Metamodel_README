The CSRM metamodel is a .mdzip project that describes the CSRM specification using UML classes. 

The metamodel is composed of a data model and a process model. 

The data model contains CSRM-specific model elements that describe things, such as a Mission.

The process model contains CSRM-specific relationships such as Validation.

The intent of the metamodel is to provide a greater understanding of the CSRM model elements and the allowable relationships between them.
